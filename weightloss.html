<summary><b>Factors that goes into Weight Loss</b></summary>
  

  
    <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Starting weight</b>
      <br>People who weigh more tend to shed more pounds than those who weighless. Still, the percentage of body weight lost is similar.</br>
  </li> 
  <li> <b>Age</b>
    <p> Older people tend to carry more fat mass and less muscle mass, which reduces your RMR, or how many calories your body burns at rest. A lower RMR can make it more difficult to lose weight.</p>
 </li> 
  <li> <b>Gender</b>
 <p>  Women tend to have a greater fat to muscle ratio than men, which
can affect their RMR. As a result, men tend to lose weight quicker than
women, even if they consume a similar number of calories</p>
</li> 
<li> <b>Age</b>
  <p>Weight loss occurs when you burn more calories than you consume. Thus, a calorie deficit is essential to losing weight. </p>
  </li> 
<li> <b>Sleep</b>
     <p> Studies have found that a lack of sleep may slow the rate at which you lose weight and even increase your cravings for unhealthy foods.</p>
   </li> 
<li> <b>Medical Conditions</b>
       <p>People with medical conditions like depression and hypothyroidism may lose weight at a slower rate. </p>
</li> 
<li> <b>Genetics</b>
<p>Studies have shown that weight loss has a genetic component, which may affect certain people with obesity.</p>
</li> 
</ul>
